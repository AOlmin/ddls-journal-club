- Each session starts with a presentation by the host (around 15 minutes), followed by discussion between all participants.

### Host instructions
- Select a paper that you believe to align with the topic of the journal club. If relevant, you can also select 1-2 additional papers which you think could add to the discussion or knowledge of the participants.
- Share the paper with the participants at least **1 week** prior to the designated session by sending an e-mail to <amanda.olmin@gu.se>.
